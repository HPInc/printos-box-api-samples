# PrintOS Box

The PrintOS Box file upload API allows 3rd party applications to upload files directly into the PrintOS Box application.

The PrintOS Box application also allows user to easily upload and manage files between customers and print service providers, while providing automated services like pre-flighting and print automation.

##General Information
The use of the Box API requires the generation of HMAC authentication headers. These are generated with a Key/Secret from PrintOS.
If you're a third party without a Key/Secret, visit [Box API Access] (https://developers.hp.com/printos/doc/api-authentication) to request access.

For existing PrintOS users, you can generate your own Key/Secret following the instructions [Here] (https://www.dropbox.com/s/qbwmnniehw2jn0s/Requesting%20an%20API.pdf?dl=0)
